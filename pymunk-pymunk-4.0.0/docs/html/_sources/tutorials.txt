Tutorials
=========

List of included tutorials. Make sure to also check out the 
:ref:`Examples <examples>` as most of them are easy to follow and showcase 
many of the things you can do with pymunk.

It is a good idea to start with the Slide and Pin Joint tutorial. It will 
walk you through the basics for a simple simulation.

If you have made a tutorial that is using pymunk in any way and want it 
mentioned here please send me a link and I will happily link it. I also 
accept full tutorials to include directly here if you prefer, as long as they
are of reasonable quality and style. Check the source to see how the existing 
ones are built.
