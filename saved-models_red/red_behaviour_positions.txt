Following values needs to be replaced for manually creating Red Behaviour subpolicies in carmunk.py file

Replace the following lines in the code with following values as required:

This code can be found at Line 39 and Line 134 in the carmunk.py file.

Line 39
# Create the car.
self.create_car(150, 20, 15)


Line 134

self.car_body.angle = 1.4

change the matrix with any of the following values and you will find the toy car relocated when you run ManualControl.py file.

Then guide it manually and save the weights of each of the eight sub policies.
 
1) (150, 20, 15) angle=1.4

2) (50, 360, 15) angle=1.4

3) (150, 640, 15) angle=1.4

4) (600, 640, 15) angle=1.4

5) (930, 580, 15) angle=200

6) (930, 280, 15) angle=200

7) (850, 40, 15) angle=110

8) (550, 40, 15) angle=110

Videos of each subpolicies trained manually using manualContol.py file is also attached along the folder.
